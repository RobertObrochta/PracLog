# PracticeLogWebsite

This project was uploaded on GitHub using the Apache 2.0 License.

This is my first project ever. I used HTML, CSS, and PHP to build a website that documents a musician's practice session for each day. 
The website offers a few prompts, where the user may enter their responses to the prompts. Once submitted, the prompts are emailed directly to the user's inputted email.
In the survey page, the user may email me any information regarding their thoughts on the website, what they would like added, and the likes.

I am a music education major looking to get more into programming as a whole, so this project gels both of my interests in music and in programming.

---Enjoy---

# December Update
I've decided to expand on this project, and revive it as a social media app called PracLog. Read more about it in my PracLog repo! <https://github.com/RobertObrochta/Opus>
